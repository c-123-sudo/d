/*4) Consider the following relations containing the airline flight information:
Flights(fino:integer, from:string, to:string, distance: integer,
departs:time, arrives:time)
Aircraft (aid:integer, aname:string, cruising range: integer)
Certified (eid:integer, aid:integer)
Employees (eid: integer, ename:string, salary: integer)
Note that the employees relation describes pilots and other kinds of employees as well; every pilot is certified for some aircraft, only pilots are certified to fly. Write the SQL queries for the following questions:
i) Find the names of pilots who can operate planes with a range greater than 3000 miles but are not certified on any Jet aircraft.
ii) Find the eids of employees who make the highest salary.
iii) Find the eids of employees who are certified for the largest number of aircraft.
iv) Find the total amount paid to employees a salaries.
